 Restaurats are able to create two types campaigns via Toproffer. First one is permanent campaign, it is applicable on the specified days and specified hours, and valid as long as it is deleted. It is common campaign type that restaurants make. The other one is momentarily campaign, restaurants are able to create campaign that is applicable on the specified duration and campaign is deleted after the duration is finished.

 Also, Toproffer assists restaurants by showing all the applied campaigns categorically on the graph. Campaign categories are seperated with the colors. For example, at 6 pm, there are 42 alcohol campaigns applied via Toproffer by the customers on Monday. Days can be selected from the top. Restaurants can get assist from this graph when creating a campaign.
 


 Restaurants can see the details of the campaign by tapping the desired campaign from the list. They can get the campaign code by clicking the "Get Code" button. Code of the campaign is used when a customer wants to benefit from the campaign. Restaurant gives the campaign code to customer and customer enters the code to benefit the campaign.
