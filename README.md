<img src="/assets/logo.jpeg?raw=true">  
Toproffer is a mobile application that allows restaurants to publish their campaigns to customers and allows customers to benefit from those campaigns. Frontend of this application is implemented using **Flutter** framework and backend is **Firebase** with **Dart** language. 

## Application Features 

There are two user types in this application. One of them is Restaurants, and the other one is Customers.

### 1. Restaurants 

 Restaurats are able to create two types campaigns via Toproffer. First one is permanent campaign, it is applicable on the specified days and specified hours, and valid as long as it is deleted. It is common campaign type that restaurants make. The other one is momentarily campaign, restaurants are able to create campaign that is applicable on the specified duration and campaign is deleted after the duration is finished. First gif in below demonstrates creating momentarily campaign in this application. 

 Also, Toproffer assists restaurants by showing all the applied campaigns categorically on the graph. Campaign categories are seperated with the colors. For example, at 6 pm, there are 42 alcohol campaigns applied via Toproffer by the customers on Monday. Days can be selected from the top. Restaurants can get assist from this graph when creating a campaign. Second gif in below demonstrates graph feature of Toproffer.
 
 Restaurants can see the details of the campaign by tapping the desired campaign from the list. They can get the campaign code by clicking the "Get Code" button. Code of the campaign is used when a customer wants to benefit from the campaign. Restaurant gives the campaign code to customer and customer enters the code to benefit the campaign. Third gif in below demonstrates this feateure.

### 2. Customers 
 
 Customers can benefit from the campaigns that are created by restaurants via Toproffer. With the help of the Google Maps, customers can easily search around the active campaigns from their location. They can see the details of the campaigns on the bottom by tapping the pins on the map, and they can slide the campaigns if the selected restaurant has multiple campaigns. By tapping the pin one more time, the closest path to the restaurant from the current location is drawn on the map. This closest path is the closest paths for the vehicles. Example usage of the map is shown in the first gif, below. 
 
 Also, customers can see all the campaigns as list. By tapping the desired campaign in the list, they can see the details of the campaign. If they want to benefit from that campaign, they need to enter the code that restaurant provides. The example usage of the campaign application is shown in the second gif, below.   
 
 If the customer wants to see the information of the restaurant, its active and old campaigns they can search the restaurant from the restaurants tab. If they want to get notified whenever the restaurant creates a campaign, they can follow them. The example of following a campaign is shown in the third gif, below.
